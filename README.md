# Airline-Reservation-System
The repository hosts an ASP.NET Core web application, which is my defence project for the ASP.NET Core course at softuni.bg.

The application offers the following functionalities:

-for users:
  * making/canceling a booking
  * flight check-in (in form of editing passenger data)
  * purchase flight baggade & report baggage as lost


-for admin users (admin area):
  * manage user roles (Administrator, Fleet & flight manager)
  * add aircraft to fleet (fleet manager only)
  * add/remove flight route (flight manager only)
  * add/cancel flight
